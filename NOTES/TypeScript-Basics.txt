TYPESCRIPT with it's static type checking, you get to learn about potential bugs as you're typing the code, than heading to 
the browser and figuring out at runtime.

It also provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete.
It makes maintenance and refactoring of large code bases much easier.



What is TypeScript ?
> It is an open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a typed superset 
  of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript which is understood by the Browsers.

> In simple terms, combine the JavaScript we know with ES6, ES7 and a few additional features and the end
  product is TypeScript. It is also the main programming language of Angular.

Why TypeScript ?
> TypeScript is superior to its counterparts like CoffeeScript & Dart in a way that TypeScript is just
  extended JavaScript. Dart & CoffeeScript are new languages in themselves while TypeScript is not.

  We can even rename a `.js` extension file to `.ts` and it'd work perfectly fine.

> The second reason is optional static typing and type inference.
  JavaScript is dynamically typed which means JavaScript does not know what type a variable is 
  until it is actually instantiated at runtime which is too late.

  TypeScript on the other hand adds type support to JavaScript. As a result, errors are identified as & when 
  you type your code and during the compilation step. This results in less error-prone code.
  
  Specifying the type is completely optional. When you don't specify a type, TypeScript will infer the type
  for you and still point out the errors which would otherwise be seen only during runtime.

>> To compile the .ts file's code to plain JavaScript using the Typescript compiler, run the following command.
>> tsc <file_name>.ts

The command will create a file <file_name>.js which contains the transpiled code.

If we've the following content in our .ts file, 

let message = 'Hello World';
console.log(message)

We might've noticed an error over there (on hovering over the message variable which shows red-underline.), 
 "Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'message' "

 This happens because the file is treated as a script rather than a module. A module has its own scope whereas 
 scripts share the global scope. To get rid of this error, we need to add an export statement at the top which 
 exports nothing.

 By adding an import or export statement, TypeScript treats that file as a module instead of a script.

 If we modify our .ts file like below, 

 export {}
 let message = 'Hello World';
 console.log(message)

 The error will disappear & the change will be reflected in the .js file as well.

 Variable Types in TypeScript :- 

 to declare a variable with type in TS,
 Syntax -->  let variableName : datatype = value
 Example --> let isBeginner : boolean = true 
 
 we have another type called `any`. That type does not do any

 let myVariable : any = 10
  
 With myVariable, a number of errors can occur. Say we do something as below.
 
 console.log(myVariable.name)
 myVariable();
 myVariable.toUpperCase();

 TypeScript will not force us to do any checking before we try to call, construct or access properties on these values.
 Therefore, it won't throw any error because our variable is off type `any`. To tackle this issue, 
 TypeScript 3.0 introduced a new type called `unknown`.

 `unknown` type is very similar to the `any` type. So, any value is assignable to type unknown. However, you can't
 access any properties off of an `unknown` type nor can you call or construct them.

 let myVariable: unknown = 10;
 
 console.log(myVariable.name);
 myVariable();
 myVariable.toUpperCase();

 If we change the variable to type `unknown` from type `any`, we'll get the errors right away. 
 
 Error => 'myVariable' is of type 'unknown'. To be able to get rid of the errors, we need to 
 use a type assertion to convince the type system that we know better.

 Make change as follows, 

 (myVariable as string).toUpperCase();

 Now, TypeScript assumes that we've made the necessary check. Type assertion is similar to type casting 
 in other languages. We're saying that myVariable should be treated as a string and then the toUpperCase 
 method can be applied.

TypeScript also has the ability to specify union of types for the same variable.

example :- let multitype: number | boolean;
           multiType = 20;
           multiType = true;

A use case for specifying multiple types would be when a value is not under your control. It could come from 
a library, from an API which might send a numeric value as a string value or from user inputs.

In that case, we might have a question as to why should we use multiple types (a.k.a union of types) 
instead of just any type ?

> We could have easily written like this, 

  let anyType: any;
  anyType = 20;
  anyType = true;

  There are two reasons mainly for that :- 

  1) The UNION types restrict to the specified types whereas the any type has no restrictions.
  2) Intellisense support
