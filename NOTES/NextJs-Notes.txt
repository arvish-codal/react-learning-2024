What is Next.js ?
> It is a React Framework for building web applications.

When building applications with React alone, it's not feasible to create a fully featured application 
ready for production. 

React is a library for building User interfaces (UI), responsible only for the view layer of an application.
As a developer, we need to make decisions about other features such as routing, data fetching and more.

Next.Js on the other hand is a React Framework. It uses React for building user interfaces but also provides
additional features that enable you to build production-ready applications.

These features include routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundling, compiling and more. We don't need 
to install additional packages as Next.js provides everything we need.

However, NextJs being a framework has opinions and conventions that should be followed to implement these features.
