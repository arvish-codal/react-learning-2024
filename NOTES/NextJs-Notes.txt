What is Next.js ?
> It is a React Framework for building web applications.

When building applications with React alone, it's not feasible to create a fully featured application 
ready for production. 

React is a library for building User interfaces (UI), responsible only for the view layer of an application.
As a developer, we need to make decisions about other features such as routing, data fetching and more.

Next.Js on the other hand is a React Framework. It uses React for building user interfaces but also provides
additional features that enable you to build production-ready applications.

These features include routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundling, compiling and more. We don't need 
to install additional packages as Next.js provides everything we need.

However, NextJs being a framework has opinions and conventions that should be followed to implement these features.


To create a new NextJS project, we need to run the following command :- 
  - npx create-next-app@latest

The `.next` folder --> This folder is generated when we run either the dev or build scripts. (i.e for example - npm run dev)
It is from this folder that our NextJS application is served.

The `node_modules` folder --> This is where all the dependencies of our project are installed.

The `public` folder --> This folder holds all the static assets to be served such as images and SVG's.

Inside the `src` folder, we've one folder called app which is the newly introduced app router.

In the context of `Hello-World` project, 
> When we run the command `npm run dev`, the execution is transferred to `layout.tsx`, 
  The `RootLayout` Component is rendered.

> When we navigate to localhost:3000, the children prop will always refer to the component defined in `page.tsx` 
  in the `app` folder. That component is the `Home` component which is then rendered in the browser.

  React Server Components is a new architecture introduced by the React team in version 18.
  The architecture introduces a new way of creating React Components - splitting them into two types :-
   - Server Components & Client Components

> Server Components :- 
 - In Next.js, all components are Server components by default. They have the ability to run tasks like reading files or
   fetching data from a database. 
 - However, they don't have the ability to use Hooks or handle user interactions.

> Client Compontoents :-

 - To create a Client component, it's necessary to add "use client" at the top of the component file. Client components are the
   traditional React components.

NextJS has a file-system based routing mechanism where the URL paths accessible in the browser are defined by files & folders within 
our codebase.

Routing Conventions 
 - All routes must be placed inside the app folder.
 - Every file that corresponds to a route must be named page.js or page.tsx 
 - Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL.

 When these conventions are followed, the file automatically becomes available as a route.
