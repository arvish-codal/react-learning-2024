>> Create-React-App is a command line interface tool that allows us to quickly
   create and run React Applications with no configuration.

>> What that means is we simply run a command and an entire React project is 
   created for us.

* What is NPX ? 
-> NPX is an npm package runner which gets installed when you install Node.
   And that is how we're directly able to run, create React App without 
   having to install it. NPX takes care of that for us.

* package.json 
-> This files contain the dependencies and the scripts required for the project.
   
* package-lock.json 
-> Based on whether we have just `npm` or `yarn` as a package manager, we're gonna see yarn-lock or package-lock files.
-> They simply ensure consistent installation of your dependencies.

* node_modules
-> The folder in which all the depencencies are installed. Generated when we run `npm install` or `create-react-app`
   command.

* Functional Component & Class Component 
-> What is the advantage of using one over the other and when 
   exactly should you use a particular component type ?

-> Earlier, Functional components were stateless. But, Hooks are a new 
   feature proposal that lets you use state and other React features 
   without writing a class.

Before jumping in to hooks - few things to consider 
  - learn how to use state, lifecycle methods and `this` binding in Class components.

* JSX - JavaScript XML - Extension to the JavaScript language syntax.
- Write XML-like code for elements and components.
- JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children.
- JSX ultimately transpiles to pure JavaScript which is understood by the browsers.

- Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.CreateElement
