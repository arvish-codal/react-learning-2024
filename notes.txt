>> Create-React-App is a command line interface tool that allows us to quickly
   create and run React Applications with no configuration.

>> What that means is we simply run a command and an entire React project is 
   created for us.

* What is NPX ? 
-> NPX is an npm package runner which gets installed when you install Node.
   And that is how we're directly able to run, create React App without 
   having to install it. NPX takes care of that for us.

* package.json 
-> This files contain the dependencies and the scripts required for the project.
   
* package-lock.json 
-> Based on whether we have just `npm` or `yarn` as a package manager, we're gonna see yarn-lock or package-lock files.
-> They simply ensure consistent installation of your dependencies.

* node_modules
-> The folder in which all the depencencies are installed. Generated when we run `npm install` or `create-react-app`
   command.
